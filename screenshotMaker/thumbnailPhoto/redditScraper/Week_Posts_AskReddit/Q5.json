All of our technology has to keep being retooled and recreated and upgraded and reinforced, for pretty much no other reason than to combat society's assholes. Every conceivable thing that we do needs to be redone, over and over, to prevent scumbags from abusing and manipulating it. You can't just have a password! You need it to contain at least eight characters, and they must include upper and lowercase letters and numbers and special characters, and then you need to prove you're not a robot, and then you need to click on all the pictures of trains, and then you need to have your authenticator code, and then you need to enter the code we sent via email. But then your password was exposed on the dark web so you need to do all of that 47 times for all of your accounts because someone used your bank account to get an Uber into NYC.

            "commentText": "Large Swaths of the internet.  Archive while you can folks.\n\nEdit 1: To explain a bit since so many are asking. This has already happened before and continues to happen. Many old websites do no longer exist from the web of old. Whether it be corporations that shut things down, people who no longer run their little own websites,  or the consolidation of the web which has led to smaller sites being killed in some manner over the past 25 years.\n\nThink of all the things that have been removed or changed over the past 25 years of the internet. How much do you currently use that you think is going to survive the next 25? You can't guarantee most things are going to still be around.\n\nSome corporations and things that were once popular aren't anymore and get shut down entirely. Think about how popular Vine was for a time and now everything that wasn't saved and no one has direct access to is effectively gone.\n\nMega-Corporations such as Google shut down their less profitable aspects all the time. There are numerous discontinued services and programs that they once ran.\n\nThink of the millions of websites, games, animations that weren't converted to anything, that weren't saved by anyone else, and are just gone or have portions unusable when Adobe Flash shuttered its doors for good in 2020. Things such as Flashpoint, which saved a great many thousands of things, certainly most of the popular works, ultimately saved so little comparably to what was out there.\n\nThings that were once popular don't last forever and since it's not profitable for any corporation to want to archive this sort of material for any lengthy period of time it's up to the users of the internet to do it themselves. If you don't save the thing you love, there's no guarantee anyone else will.\n\nAnother thing: YOUR HOME TAPES. Tapes degrade and you probably aren't storing them the best. They will and have been losing quality over the years. Some day they simply won't work at all.\n\nIf you got any you haven't transferred to another platform, do it.  The best time to transfer your tape has always been Right Now for quite some time and that's how it will continue to be in the foreseeable future. If you have older relatives with tapes offer to do it for them. Odds are they don't know this is going to happen to their tapes, a lot of people don't.\n\nYou don't want records of your family's past to be gone forever, memories recorded that can no longer exist.\n\nThere are fairly cheap capture cards you can buy so you can hook up your VCR to your computer then record it directly onto your PC. Some come with their own software you can use, but you can always just use OBS (Open Broadcasting Software) or something similar as well. It's not that super complicated but if you struggle online guides exist and are fairly easy to find.\n\nOr you go the route of copying it to a DVD disc should you have the materials and technology on hand. Which you can then store/also put on your PC or an external drive somewhere. You can even make multiple copies if you're worried about losing such things, in fact, I recommend it if you can.\n\nIf you find yourself struggling to do so, there are always professionals you can pay to do it for you, though it will cost you quite a bit depending on how many tapes you have and what you need to preserve.\n",
