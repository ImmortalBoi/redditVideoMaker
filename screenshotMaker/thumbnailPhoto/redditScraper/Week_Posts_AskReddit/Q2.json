I'm imagining a future scholar referencing the future of what a tablet looks like, squinting hard for a moment, then speaking, with heavy accent, a mix of slang from the 80's till today, in a way that may make logical sense but out of context, is still pretty much jibberish.Edit: to the plethora of comments saying tech will be so advanced and we save so much more information than 1000 years ago... You all assume in 1000 years we will have advanced versions of technology similar to today.. If people are around 1000 years from now our internet and digital data keeping will seem primitive and vastly outdated. They may find it frustratingly difficult to navigate these ancient physical media storage devices from the time with specific encoding of a long dead programming language nobody has used for over 800 years... \"I mean their computers were still on a binary system! can you imagine quantum computing for them took weeks and a warehouse of servers to do what we now can do with a pea sized implant!\"",
