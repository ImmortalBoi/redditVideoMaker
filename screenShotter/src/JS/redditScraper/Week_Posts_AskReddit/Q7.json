We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Henry. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then they'll go inside, pen a brief missive to their departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without their one true platonic love.Edit: if you don’t know what this is, look it up\nEdit 2: I never thought something erotic would’ve been my most upvoted comment but here we are lol",

The way his pectoralis major meets his anterior deltoid, the way his middle delt is built to be square and loom over his perfect arms, his tricep definition, his abs from top to bottom and the way his V demands, regardless of your sexuality, that your eyes keep moving southward…His skin is perfect and glows like the sun, his hair is the perfect length to make him appear both bohemian and excessively masculine, his perfect smile and childlike aura. \n\nAnyone who works out can tell you that this is entirely genetic, countless numbers of people have been exercising for millennia and they do not look like Brendan Fraser from GotJ. \n\nBrendan doesn’t even look like Brendan from GotJ in any other movie because that’s an excessively difficult thing to. Not only did he start with perfect genetics, decide to become an actor, exercise in the exact way he needed and adhere to a strict diet, male actors also need to be dehydrated to the brink of death because even people who are in amazing physical shape do not look that defined on a daily basis. \n\nSo for one brief shining moment all of the atomic structure of the universe conspired and Brendan was a perfect human. \n\nAnd he did it all for you, films are meant to be seen and he wanted you to see it. And not for some high minded Oscar winning film, he did it for George of the Jungle. Through great effort and cosmic circumstance, on the brink of death, working 18 hours days Brendan labored tirelessly so that he could be immortalized on film and observed by you…in George of the jungle. The absolute audacity of his generosity is humbling, Brendan for one shining moment was a God and he was generous. \n\nSo bear witness to the Adonis that is Brendan Fraser in “George of the Jungle”, we have never and will never see anything so magnificent.\n\nAnd always remember, with his whole heart he did it for you.\n",

She asks what I do. I say I loved her in New Girl. She laughs. I get my drink. “Well, see ya,” I say and walk away. I’ve got her attention now. How many guys voluntarily leave a conversation with Nathalie Portman? She touches her neck as she watches me leave. Later, as the night’s dragged on and the coterie of gorgeous narcissists grows increasingly loose, she finds me on the balcony, my bowtie undone, smoking a cigarette. “Got a spare?” she asks. “What’s in it for me?” I say as I hand her one of my little white ladies. She smiles. “Conversation with me, duh.” I laugh. “What’s so funny?” she protests. “Nothing, nothing… It’s just… don’t you grow tired of the egos?” “You get used to it,” she says, lighting her cigarette and handing me back the lighter. “What would you do if you weren’t an actress?” I ask. “Teaching, I think.” “And if I was your student, what would I be learning?” “Discipline,” she says quickly, looking up into my eyes, before changing the subject. “Where are you from?” “Bermuda,” I say. “Oh wow. That’s lovely.” “It’s ok,” I admit. “Not everything is to my liking.” “What could possibly be not to your liking in Bermuda?” she inquires. “I don’t like sand,” I tell her. “It’s coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.”",
