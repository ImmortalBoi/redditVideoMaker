The city with the biggest ‚Äúfuck around and find out‚Äù attitude! And suddenly the internet was filled with all these crazy stories of how Philly beheaded a friendly hitchhiking robot or booed a baby in Mets gear at a Phillies game or threw snowballs at Santa Claus during an Eagles game or how a rapper was maced by a ‚Äúfan‚Äù while on stage.Last year group of white nationalists tried to ‚Äúmarch‚Äù in Philly and were so badly scared by the residents that they went running home. It‚Äôs a little like having a fucking batshit crazy girlfriend who is so loyal and psycho she‚Äôll try to stab anyone who talks shit.
